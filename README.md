# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Using-YOLO-and-OpenCV

## Description
A real-time system that detects and labels multiple objects in video or webcam feeds using YOLO and OpenCV. The project demonstrates object detection with high accuracy and efficiency, suitable for applications like surveillance, automation, and smart monitoring.

## Features
- Real-time object detection via webcam or video file
- Detects multiple objects simultaneously
- Draws bounding boxes and labels for each detected object
- Uses YOLO for fast and accurate detection
- Easy to integrate and extend for other applications
